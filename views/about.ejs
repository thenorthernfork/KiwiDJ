<h1>About KiwiDJ</h1>
<p>KiwiDJ was a project started by <a href="http://twitter.com/medsouz">medsouz</a> to create an open source alternative to the popular DJ sites <a href="turntable.fm">turntable.fm</a> and <a href="plug.dj">plug.dj</a>.</p>
<h3>Contributing</h3>
<p>We are currently looking for people who would like to contribute to the project. This is medsouz's first experience in web development and he is probably doing a lot of things wrong. Any corrections or contributions would be appreciated on the <i class="icon-github"></i> <a href="http://github.com/medsouz/KiwiDJ">Github page</a>.</p>
